        <p className="font-medium">
          MHB Academy needs to gather and use certain information about
          individuals, including customers, suppliers, business contacts,
          employees, and other relevant parties. This policy describes how
          personal data must be collected, handled, and stored to meet the
          company’s data protection standards and comply with the law.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">Purpose:</h3>
        <p className="font-medium">
          This data protection policy ensures MHB Academy:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>Complies with data protection law and follows good practices.</li>
          <li>Protects the rights of staff, customers, and partners.</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>Protects itself from the risks of a data breach.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">Data Protection:</h3>
        <p className="font-medium">
          While data protection guidelines are still being drafted by the
          government, MHB Academy endeavors to ensure data is not misused. Our
          philosophy is governed by seven important principles:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>Processed fairly and lawfully</li>
          <li>Obtained only for specific, lawful purposes</li>
          <li>Adequate, relevant, and not excessive</li>
          <li>Accurate and kept up to date</li>
          <li>Not held for any longer than necessary</li>
          <li>Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects</li>
          <li>Protected in appropriate ways</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">Policy Scope:</h3>
        <p className="font-medium">
          This policy applies to all staff, branches, contractors, volunteers,
          suppliers, and other individuals working on behalf of MHB Academy. It
          covers all data that the company holds relating to identifiable
          individuals, including names, postal addresses, email addresses,
          telephone numbers, and any other information relating to individuals.

          <li className="font-medium">
            Breaches of confidentiality, such as information being given out
            inappropriately.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Failing to offer choice, where individuals should be free to express
            objections about how their data is used.

            Reputational damage, such as suffering consequences if hackers gain

        <p className="font-medium">
          The only people able to access data covered by this policy should be
          those who need it for their work. Data should not be shared
          informally. When access to confidential information is required,
          employees can request it from their line managers. Mr. Saurabh will
          provide training to all employees to help them understand their
          responsibilities when handling data. Employees should keep all data
          secure, by taking sensible precautions and following the guidelines

          <li className="font-medium">
            Employees should request help from their line manager or the data
            protection officer if they are unsure about any aspect of data
            protection.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">Data Storage:</h3>
        <p className="font-medium">
          These rules describe how and where data should be safely stored.
          Questions about storing data safely can be directed to the IT manager
          or data controller.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li className="font-medium">
            When data is stored on paper, it should be kept in a secure place
            where unauthorized people cannot see it.
          </li>

            When not required, paper or files should be kept in a locked drawer
            or filing cabinet.

          <li className="font-medium">
            Data printouts should be shredded and disposed of securely when no

          <li className="font-medium">
            Data should be protected by strong passwords that are changed

          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">Data Use:</h3>
        <p className="font-medium">
          Personal data is of no value to MHB Academy unless the business can
          make use of it. However, it is when personal data is accessed and used
          that it can be at the greatest risk of loss, corruption, or theft.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li className="font-medium">
            When working with personal data, employees should ensure the screens
            of their computers are always locked when left unattended.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Personal data should not be shared informally. In particular, it
            should never be sent by email, as this form of communication is not
            secure.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Data must be encrypted before being transferred electronically. The
            IT manager can explain how to send data to authorized external
            contacts.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Personal data should never be transferred outside the intended
            jurisdiction.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Employees should not save copies of personal data to their own
            computers.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Always access and update the central copy of any data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">Data Accuracy:</h3>
        <p className="font-medium mt-2">
          The common sense requires MHB Academy to take reasonable steps to
          ensure data is kept accurate and up to date. The more important it is
          that the personal data is accurate, the greater the effort MHB Academy
          should put into ensuring its accuracy.
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium mt-4">
          It is the responsibility of all employees who work with data to take
          reasonable steps to ensure it is kept as accurate and up to date as
          possible. Data will be held in as few places as necessary. Staff
          should not create any unnecessary additional data sets.
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium mt-4">
          Staff should take every opportunity to ensure data is updated. For
          instance, by confirming a customer’s details when they call. MHB
          Academy will make it easy for data subjects to update the information
          MHB Academy holds about them. They may get in touch with the current
          point of contact in the company, and the employee will do the needful.
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium mt-4">
          Data should be updated as inaccuracies are discovered. For instance,
          if a customer can no longer be reached on their stored telephone
          number, it should be removed from the database. It is the marketing
          manager’s responsibility to ensure marketing databases are checked
          against industry suppression files every six months.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">
          Subject Access Requests:
        </h3>
        <p className="font-medium mt-2">
          All individuals who are the subject of personal data held by MHB
          Academy are entitled to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-4">
          <li className="font-medium">
            Ask what information the company holds about them and why.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">Ask how to gain access to it.</li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Be informed how to keep it up to date.
          </li>
          <li className="font-medium">
            Be informed how the company is meeting its data protection
            obligations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="font-medium mt-4">
          If an individual contacts the company requesting this information,
          this is called a subject access request. Subject access requests from
          individuals should be made by email, addressed to the data controller
          at info@myhealtybuddy.co. The data controller can supply a standard
          request form, although individuals do not have to use this.
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium mt-4">
          Individuals will be charged INR 500 per subject access request. The
          data controller will aim to provide the relevant data within 14 days.
          The data controller will always verify the identity of anyone making a
          subject access request before handing over any information.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">
          Disclosing data for other reasons:
        </h3>
        <p className="font-medium">
          In certain circumstances, we may need to allow personal data to be
          disclosed to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the data
          subject. Under these circumstances, MHB Academy will disclose
          requested data. However, the data controller will ensure the request
          is legitimate, seeking assistance from the board and from the
          company’s legal advisers where necessary.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-[20px] font-bold pt-10">Providing information:</h3>
        <p className="font-medium">
          MHB Academy aims to ensure that individuals are aware that their data
          is being processed, and that they understand:

          To these ends, the company has a privacy statement, setting out how
